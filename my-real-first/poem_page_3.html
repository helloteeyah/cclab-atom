<h4>About: “Self"</h4>

<h6>There are several quotes that makes it apparent that Whitman does not consider the <br>narrator to represent a single individual. Rather, he seems to be narrating for all:</h6>

  <li>"I am large, I contain multitudes"</li>
  <li>"For every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you"</li>
  <li>"In all people I see myself, none more and not one a barleycorn less”</li>
  <li>"It is you talking just as much as myself... I act as the tongue of you"</li>
